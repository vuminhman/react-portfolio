        testimonial: "Man Vu joined my team around 8 months ago. Overall, it was a pleasure to work with him.\n\n Even though Man is just a co-op student, his ability to create solutions to complex problems was amazing. Man saved our team countless hours by creating standalone utilities carrying out tedious tasks.\n\n Man was also one of the only co-ops that had good experience with legacy and C++ development, which was impressive.\n\n Overall, Man was an incredibly valuable addition to our team due to his exceptional technical skills."

        relationship: "Brett managed Man directly",
        testimonial: "Before we were coworkers, Man and I were students together at Mohawk College. Even then, he was already known in our year for breaking multiple class records with code that he wrote in our infamously difficult data structures and algorithms course.\n\n Over the past 3 years, he has approached his work with the same creative problem solving skills that made him a stellar student. Man regularly contributes pieces of work that streamline labor-intensive manual processes.\n\n I've lost track of how many new things he has taught me, and I'm thankful to have spent so much of my development career with him thus far.\n\n In a sentence, Man is a naturally gifted developer who relentlessly pursues new information both inside and outside of his work."
